<h1>Missing Tealeaf Son<a class="headerlink" href="#missing-tealeaf-son" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As our adventurers prepare to travel to the dry side, they receive a lucrative job offer from the head of the Tealeaf family.</p>
<section id="last-night-in-town">
<h2>Last Night in Town<a class="headerlink" href="#last-night-in-town" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the party’s last night in town before going to the dry side.</p>
<section id="a-job-offer">
<h3>A Job Offer<a class="headerlink" href="#a-job-offer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The adventurers have all joined a caravan headed from Camellia to the dry side and will depart in the morning.
The party has been invited to a dinner meeting with the head of the Tealeaf family in a room at the Saddle Gap Inn.
She is running late, but food is brought in and the party has an opportunity to get acquainted with one another.</p>
<p>Ms Tealeaf arrives after dinner and offers the party a job.
She explains that her young son, Finkas Tealeaf is a guide on the dry side and he has been hired to help a group of explorers looking for the Lost City of Gold.
Finkas was supposed to make it back to Wolff Point over six months ago and is overdue.
Ms Tealeaf would like any interested adventurers in the party to go looking for her son.
She will provide the party with tonight’s lodging in the inn, provisions, and cold weather equipment if they take the job, and she will award 500 gp for Finkas’s safe return to Wolff Point or 250 gp for word of his fate.</p>

<section id="attack-in-the-night">
<h3>Attack in the Night<a class="headerlink" href="#attack-in-the-night" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The party may run some errands before turning, but they have free lodging for the night at the Saddle Gap Inn.</p>
<p>As the party is resting, they are attacked by bandits in the night!
1 Bandit per party member and 1 Bandit Captain attack the players as they are sleeping.
The Bandits will flee if the Bandit Captain or half of the Bandits are killed or incapacitated.
The Bandit Captain will not surrender but will flee if half of the Bandits are killed.</p>
<p>If the Bandits incapacitate the party, they will warn them not to look for Finkas Tealeaf.
If the party searches the Bandit Captain, they will find a piece of paper with rough descriptions of the party and the Saddle Gap Inn.
The Bandits were hired to scare the party away from taking the Tealeaf job.
The Bandit Captain was supposed to meet with a woman named Rook at a local bar called Alehouse.
Any party member with criminal contacts in the city would know that this is a local bar for members of the thieves guild in Theaceae.</p>
</section>
<section id="done-dirt-cheep">
<h3>Done Dirt Cheep<a class="headerlink" href="#done-dirt-cheep" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the party chooses to follow-up on the note in the Bandit Captain’s pocket, they can receive payment for their own assault, if they can bluff their way through the situation!</p>
<p>The Alehouse is one of a myriad of grungy bars in Camellia.
Party members will be challenged at the door and will have to lie (DC 15) or show their bounty to get in.</p>
<p>Rook (Bandit Captain) can be found at a table in the back of the bar.
The various bargoers look at least as dangerous as the group that came to attack the party, with some members looking more dangerous.</p>
<p>Rook will speak with a few members of the party.
If the party can successfully convince her that they are the bandits that attacked the party, then Rook will pay 25 gp.</p>
<p>Rook has the following knowledge about the attack:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The job came through some contacts in the thieves guild on the dry side who are looking for the Lost City of Gold.</p></li>
<li><p>These contacts do not want anyone else getting in the way of their operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Rook thinks that the Lost City of Gold is a complete myth.</p></li>
<li><p>The Lost City of Gold was an old mining town that got rich and was taken over by the wild forest.</p></li>
<li><p>Killing is a last resort for thieves in Theaceae, so Rook doubts that this group had anything to do with Finkas Tealeaf going missing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To get the payment and information from Rook, the party must succeed in a series of skill checks.
The skills must reasonably be related to convincing Rook that the party members are in the thieves guild.
The DC starts at 15.
Each successful check lowers the DC by 1.
Each unsuccessful check increases the DC by 2.</p>
<p>If the DC reaches 20, then Rook will demand that the party leaves.
Others in the bar will come to Rook’s defense if the party attacks.
Rook will let the party leave peacefully at any point.</p>

<h3>Road Habits<a class="headerlink" href="#road-habits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

Devin Wagner is the caravan master.
The caravan consists of 5 wagons, 10 goats, 5 drivers, and 6 guards, with only the party as passengers.</p>
<p>The trip over the mountains will take roughly two weeks full of long, boring days.

Any sleeping members of the party will likely not be wearing armor.</p>
<p>After party fights off the Specters, they will find an ancient elven sword on the body of the guard.

The armory is guarded by a Wraith.
A successful history check will reveal that the Wraith is trying to communicate with the party in an old form of evlish.
If the party leaves the sword, the Wraith will not attack.
