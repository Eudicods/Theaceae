<h1>Forest Travel<a class="headerlink" href="#forest-travel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The next several sessions will for a mini arc of travel adventures.
By the end of this mini arc, the party will hopefully have more of a sense of the character of the region.</p>
<section id="local-customs">
<h2>Local Customs<a class="headerlink" href="#local-customs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The party has discovered a farm where the child of the farmers has gone missing.
After some investigation, they discovered that the original owner of the farm made a deal with local spirits to leave offerings of milk and honey out in exchange for prosperity.
The wife had been taking the milk in to feed the baby.
The party believes that the baby was stolen because the family was no longer making the offerings.</p>
</section>
<section id="price-of-beauty">
<h2>Price of Beauty<a class="headerlink" href="#price-of-beauty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The party found their way through a mysterious invisible maze and made their way to a seemingly abandoned stone structure in the woods.
The structure transforms into a beautiful spa resort in the middle of a grove.</p>
<p>The spa was built by Nertha, the child of Nature and Forge.
It was once in a protected grove in the Fey realm, but the actions of the druids pulled this grove, along with other pieces of the Fey realm, into the mortal plane.
This lead to Nertha’s powers slowly fading.</p>
<p>Nertha made a deal with the local farmer’s family - some worship gave her some power to protect her small surviving group of followers.
Unfortunately, this was not enough, and a small coven of three fey hags was able to curse Nertha to become a Medusa.
They took over her spa and turned it into their lair.</p>
<p>Once the family failed to meet their bargain, one of the hags stole the baby and was looking to use the baby to increase her magic.</p>
<p>Half of the party decided to pay to stay in the spa while the other half explored the exterior of the resort.</p>
</section>
<section id="beauty-cleanup">
<h2>Beauty Cleanup<a class="headerlink" href="#beauty-cleanup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The shrine was once dedicated to Nature and Forge but became the prison of Nertha.
She is protective of the shrine to her parents above, which has figurines blending the elements of nature and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>The party managed to start a fight with the hags almost immediately.
This fight ran long and took the majority of the session; looting the tower was left to the next session.</p>
</section>
<section id="hidden-shrine">
<h2>Hidden Shrine<a class="headerlink" href="#hidden-shrine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The party managed to clear the remains of the hags’ tower and earned the favor of Nertha.</p>
<p>The party learned that the Fey forest is literally pieces of the Fey realm, and these pieces, along with their Fey, have been trapped this realm and unable to return to their home.</p>
<p>Upon the return, the party was invited into the back shed of the farmer.
He gave the party 1000 gold in trade or materiel, to be collected from any Friends banker.
At this point, the party is unsure if they are starting to become ailed with the Friends.</p>
<p>One of the party members threatened the farmer and threatened to kill him if the farmer did not tell his wife about his involvement with the friends.
In response, the farmer burned down his farmhouse and escaped.</p>
<p>One week further down the road towards Wolff Point, the Sisters have set up a checkpoint along the road.
The Sisters there will recognize any Sisters among the party and send them on a mission to check up on the lost Sisters encampment set up in the Fey woods.</p>
</section>
<section id="actual-hidden-shrine">
<h2>Actual Hidden Shrine<a class="headerlink" href="#actual-hidden-shrine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The trajectory of the session took a bit of a detour last time.
The party reached the Sisters encampment and checkpoint along the road to Wolff Point.</p>
<p>The parcty accepted the job to determine what happened to the Sisters team that was exploring a relatively new temple to a Fey that is trying to accrue followers as a deity of the undead.
The ruins themselves are not terribly interesting to the party because they are so young, but the party has accepted the job in the interest of maintaining good relations with the Sisters.</p>
