<h2>Crab Hag<a class="headerlink" href="#crab-hag" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>

This second portal led to a far realm with some sort of dragon’s lair.</p>
<p>The only dragon that could speak Common was an adult red dragon who claimed she made a deal with the Sister - the Sister would free her children from the influence of the Gith in exchange for the dragon burning a city of her enemies down.
The dragon isn’t too particular about who fulfills this deal, and she is even more eager to be reunited with the dragon mother, whom the party has met.</p>
