<h3>Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The party met in Camellia as members of the same caravan over the White Spine mountains.
Before they left, the head of the Tealeaf family, one of the big tea growing families in the region, offered to pay the party for news or the safety of her son, Finkas Tealeaf.
Before the party leaves Camellia for the dry side of the mountains, they are attacked by a group from the Friends, a local criminal organization, who try to dissuade the party from looking for Finkas.</p>
<p>The party followed Finkas’s trail into the Fey forest, where they are trapped by a Fey lord, the Lord of the Hunt.
They discover that Finkas has been captured by agents of another Fey lord, the Master of Whispers, and they negotiate with the Lord of the Hunt for permission to leave and find Finkas in exchange for a favor.</p>
<p>The party finds Finkas at an ancient weather control facility which was constructed by the elvish druids that used to reign in this region.
During the effort to rescue Finkas, he is poisoned and dies.
A verse of the Sisterhood, a local order of religious scholars and warriors, encounter the party on a patrol through the Fey forest, and they offer to trade the party favors - the verse of Sisters assumes the favor owed to the Lord of the Hunt and the party agrees to do a job for the Sisters.</p>
<p>Roland leaves the party to return to Camellia and inform the Tealeaf family of Finkas’s fate while the rest of the party heads to Kalkum, the headquarters of the Sisterhood.</p>

<p>In Kalkum, the party briefly meets one of the members of the senior council that runs the Sisterhood.
She shares gives the party the job they agreed to assume in exchange for the favor owed and she assigns a liaison to the party from the Sisterhood, a Sister named Ora.</p>
<p>The party makes their way to the Sunless Citadel, an abandoned citadel in a portion of the White Spine mountains claimed by the dwarves in the region.
There are rumors that the Friends are there manufacturing and selling a highly virulent poison, and the party needs to destroy the source of the poison.</p>
<p>At the Sunless Citadel, the party finds two factions trying to force each other out - the Friends and the Followers of Drache, a cult that wants to help dragons return to the region even though dragons have been believed extinct for centuries.
The party agrees to help the Followers of Drache against the Friends in exchange for help getting to the druid below the citadel who is making the poison.
Through their efforts, the party finds a dragon egg, frees a dragon, and kills an ancient druid corrupted by a tree spirit that was granting him immortality.</p>

<section id="id4">
<h3>Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Impressed with how effectively the party handled the Sunless Citadel, the Sisterhood offers the party a three job contract to investigate three weather control facilities that the elvish druids created in the region.
The Sisters believe that these sites are failing and causing chaotic weather throughout the region.</p>
<p>The first of these three sites that the party investigates is the Forge of Fury, deep in the dwarves region of the mountains.
In order to get access to the facility, the party first makes their way to Domov, where they encounter Loreia, an artificer apprenticing with the dwarves.</p>
<p>The facility is guarded by sentient plant and rock based creatures, but the party ultimately reaches the research facility where the druids lived and worked.
Making their way through these defenses, the party finds Duke Nowak, the paramour of King Banik.
The party find and frees a powerful Fey lord, the Smith, who destroys the magic that the druids were using to control the weather from this site.
As they explore the remains of the facility, the party angers another dragon and finds a living, collapsible fortress.</p>
<p>As the party makes their way back to Domov, there is an assassination attempt on Duke Nowak.
The party travels through the ley lines to reach Domov quickly and attempt to stop a coup attempt by Queen Jusic.
The dwarves are grateful for the help but demand that the party leaves immediately so they can sort out their political issues without outside interference.
Loreia stays with the dwarves, but Daestra rejoins the party.</p>

<section id="id7">
<h3>Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The party begins the long journey to the Adventuring Academy by traveling around the Fey forest.
Along the way, they encounter a bit of trouble.</p>
<p>At a local farm down the road from Kalkum, the party is hired by a local farmer to investigate their missing daughter.
The farmer’s family has been leaving offerings to local forest spirits for years, but the farmer’s wife recently stopped because of the scarcity of supplies due to the weather.
Soon after the wife stopped leaving the offerings, their daughter was taken and replaced with a unnerving duplicate.</p>
<p>The party found a local forest spirit and this spirit lead them to the Temple of the Restful Lily.
This site used to be run by Nertha, a local fey and the daughter of two gods, but she was trapped by three hags.
These hags have been preying upon locals and stole the daughter under some dubious interpretation of the original deal between Nertha and the farmer’s family.
The party freed Nertha and killed the hags.</p>
<p>The party returned the daughter and received a promissory note for supplies from the Friends in exchange.
Upon learning that the farmer was a banker for the Friends, Daestra threatened him.
He fled into the night with his family, faking their deaths by burning down the farm.</p>
<p>Further down the road the party runs into a large encampment of Sisters.
The Sisters offer the party a ‘smash and grab’ contract where the only compensation is any treasure they recover and the party accepts.</p>
<p>The party makes their way to a manufactured shrine that a minor fey was attempting to use to bolster his reputation in an attempt to make himself seem more powerful.
While investigating the bodies of a verse of Sisters that were originally sent to this shrine, the party fell into a large, subterranean temple complex.
After making their way through a series of traps and monsters, the party encounters the minor fey who created this dungeon.
He offers to make the party his champions, and the party declines, instead choosing to kill him.</p>
<p>As they prepare to leave the temple complex, the party again encounters the Smith, who agrees to enhance their weapons and armor in exchange for the party pulling him out of the magical rift in the Forge of Fury.</p>
<p>Upon their return to the Sisters encampment, the party is surprised by the sudden arrival of Sister Elisabeth from the ruling council of the Sisterhood.
She declares that due to the party’s skill and deeds, the Sisterhood recognizes the party as a partner organization striving for stability and prosperity in the region.
Ora is elevated in rank as the Sister’s ambassador to the party and the Sisters agree to give in-kind help to the party in the field.</p>

<h3>Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#id13" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Daestra collects upon the promissory note for supplies from the Friends and the party resupplies in Wolff Point.
The party follows a Treent who is looking for help saving some dryads.
The dryads are being held captive by a hag that is looking to summon a Pheonix.
The party manages to kill the hag with some subterfuge, but that leaves the Pheonix.
Ultimately, Creed agrees to go with the Lord of the Hunt and become his personal chef in exchange for the Lord of the Hunt stopping the Pheonix.</p>
<p>Resuming their journey, the party encounters two new members on the road, the rogue Lilth and an enchanted skull, Bob.
Their arrival coincides with the party meeting a strange traveler on the road who they believe is Trickster.
Soon thereafter, the party meets a group of monk-assassins, who have a contract on the party but offer to let Ekdos go free if he leaves the party within the next 24 hours.
The assassins attack the party in the middle of the night and the party takes refuge in the house.</p>
<p>During the night, the assassins create an elaborate series of traps outside of the house.
While investigating a possible escape, Daestra opens a book that was in the bundle of supplies cereived from the Friends and suddenly the party is transported to the extra-dimensional headquarters of the Friends.
Unfortunately, the party is also shrunk to one tenth of their size.
The party meets archwizard Wahn, leader of one of the factions of Friends, who mistakes them for a prank or potential apprentices.
Wahn’s familiar offers to help the party escape if they cause chaos by releasing a mimic in Wahn’s workshop.</p>
<p>The party gains a helm that lets them control the house and teleport it to ley line intersections.
Because this is very new for the party, they decide to teleport in the direction of safety and go towards Kalkum.
They unfortunately miss their mark by a small amount and have to walk a week to reach Kalkum.</p>
<p>In Kalkum, the party receives new information about a mysterious group that is rescuing Sisters from Fey capture and returning them for a reward.
The party sees a group of these dark cloaked strangers and agrees to help them rescue a group of Sisters held at a particularly dangerous location.</p>
<p>The party travels with ten of these cloaked strangers to a old elven mansion deep underground in the Fey Forest.
The husband and wife that own the mansion agree to release the Sisters they are holding captive if the party kills their brother and sister down on the third level of the mansion, as well as their Dracolich.
After some initial reconnaissance, the party gets a map of the third level.
Additionally, Daestra reaches out to the dragons and gets the Mother of Dragons to arrive and fight the Dracolich in exchange for a tribute.
The party manages to defeat the siblings and the entire mansion collapses, but the majority of the cloaked strangers die in the battle.
Before taking the rescued Sisters to safety, the leader of the cloaked strangers reveals herself to be Vanessa, a verse-mate of Ora who was believed to be dead.</p>

<p>The party teleports to the Adventuring Academy.</p>
<p>The first order of business was finding Theo, Ada’s contact who set her on the path to the cursed necklace.
He was easy to find an the party sent him off to make reparations with information.</p>
<p>The party found their way to the library and accepted the offer of the librarian to attempt capturing the shadow monks that have been stealing books and artifacts.
After waiting for several days, the party interupted a shadow monk breaking into the library and followed him back to an old tower.
This tower is the result of years of work and experiments of a local artificer called Stonky, who is trying to reproduce the efforts of the ancient druids to create teleporting structures.
Several days after the party sucessfully recovered the stolen books and artifacts from the tower, several shadow monks snuck back in and the tower teleported away.</p>
<p>After the shadow monks jumped away, the party decided to follow up on an offer from the librarian.
They headed off to recover a map that leads to the lost library of the elven druids.
The Loremonger agreed to exchange a copy of the map for the party removing a former employee that took over one of his archives.
Unbeknownst to the party, this archive also held dead gods who have been forgotten.
these gods bestowed strange gifts upon the party members as they slept.
Ultimately, the party was able to clear the archive and return to the Loremaster for their reward.</p>
<p>The party decided to head towards the desert next.</p>

<h2>Act VIII - Undead Druids<a class="headerlink" href="#act-viii-undead-druids" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<section id="id19">
<h3>Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#id19" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the desert, the party found a set of 8 standing stones.
These standing stones teleported them into the Doomvault, a facility manned and powered by undead druids.
A resurected druid who was disgruntled with undead life told the party that they needed to disrupt 6 black gates to be able to get to the heart of the Doomvault and disable the facility.
The party took his key and started making their way through the various chambers towards their goal.</p>
<p>The party managed to disable one black gate, but they retreated in the face of a powerful enemy that was too much for them.
This enemy followed the party back to the undead druid’s fighting arena, and the party disguised themselves as pit fighters.
During this fight, the party met and saved a ex-Sister who told them about a dragon being held captive in another part of the Doomvault.
The party managed to free the dragon and send him back to Kalkum for rest and recuperation.</p>
<p>Working their way through the dungeon, the party found and disabled an additional three black gates.
As they were making their way towards a fifth black gate to disable, the party discovered a portal that lead to a distant Gith military facility that held dragons captive and trained them as mounts for combat.
The party agreed to free these dragons, but this negotiation was complicated by rumors that the Sister leadership in Kalkum was aware of this subjugation of dragons and hoping to use these forces to defeat various enemies.</p>
<p>As the party explores the asteroid, they discover a group of rebel Gith prisoners.
These prisoners agree to work with the party to free the dragons and destroy the garrison on the asteroid.
During this effort, the party takes a long rest in the treeship, only to discover that the ship was build to explore the Astral Sea and wants to ‘go now’.
After convincing the ship, named Cerasus, to return to the asteroid, the rebel Gith mention that they are impressed at the party’s antique ship and may have some individuals back at their base who can repair or upgrade the treeship.</p>
<p>Back on the asteroid, the party has to rush to finish destroying the rods before the Gith garrison can escape on a supply ship that has docked.
The party killed the remaining garrison forces and secured the ship, but the rebel Gith died in the process, leaving the party responsible for the orphans.
Ultimately, one of the children stole the supply ship and Ada’s powers before running off with the rest of the children.
The dragons left through the portal back to Theaceae when the party left the asteroid to return to the Doomvault.</p>
<p>After returning to the Doomvault, the party was immediately stopped by an Aboleth.
This Aboleth offered to give the party the last gate key they needed in exchange for recovering an arcane stone.
Various monsters attempted to interfere, to include a Beholder, but the party sucessfully recovered the stone.
This stone allowed the Aboleth to grow and exit the dungeon.</p>
<p>After securing the last key, the party was able to make their way to the core of the Doomvault to disable the facility.
They got a promise of help from a necromancer who ultimately took an object from the subvaults in the core of the facility and disappeared.
As the core of the Doomvault collapsed upon itself, the party found themselves in a field full of tea leaves on the opposite side of the mountains.</p>
