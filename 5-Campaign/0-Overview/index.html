<h3>Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The party met in Camellia as members of the same caravan over the White Spine mountains.
Before they left, the head of the Tealeaf family, one of the big tea growing families in the region, offered to pay the party for news or the safety of her son, Finkas Tealeaf.
Before the party leaves Camellia for the dry side of the mountains, they are attacked by a group from the Friends, a local criminal organization, who try to dissuade the party from looking for Finkas.</p>
<p>The party followed Finkas’s trail into the Fey forest, where they are trapped by a Fey lord, the Lord of the Hunt.
They discover that Finkas has been captured by agents of another Fey lord, the Master of Whispers, and they negotiate with the Lord of the Hunt for permission to leave and find Finkas in exchange for a favor.</p>
<p>The party finds Finkas at an ancient weather control facility which was constructed by the elvish druids that used to reign in this region.
During the effort to rescue Finkas, he is poisoned and dies.
A verse of the Sisterhood, a local order of religious scholars and warriors, encounter the party on a patrol through the Fey forest, and they offer to trade the party favors - the verse of Sisters assumes the favor owed to the Lord of the Hunt and the party agrees to do a job for the Sisters.</p>
<p>Roland leaves the party to return to Camellia and inform the Tealeaf family of Finkas’s fate while the rest of the party heads to Kalkum, the headquarters of the Sisterhood.</p>

<section id="id1">
<h3>Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In Kalkum, the party briefly meets one of the members of the senior council that runs the Sisterhood.
She shares gives the party the job they agreed to assume in exchange for the favor owed and she assigns a liaison to the party from the Sisterhood, a Sister named Ora.</p>
<p>The party makes their way to the Sunless Citadel, an abandoned citadel in a portion of the White Spine mountains claimed by the dwarves in the region.
There are rumors that the Friends are there manufacturing and selling a highly virulent poison, and the party needs to destroy the source of the poison.</p>
<p>At the Sunless Citadel, the party finds two factions trying to force each other out - the Friends and the Followers of Drache, a cult that wants to help dragons return to the region even though dragons have been believed extinct for centuries.
The party agrees to help the Followers of Drache against the Friends in exchange for help getting to the druid below the citadel who is making the poison.
Through their efforts, the party finds a dragon egg, frees a dragon, and kills an ancient druid corrupted by a tree spirit that was granting him immortality.</p>

<section id="id4">
<h3>Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Impressed with how effectively the party handled the Sunless Citadel, the Sisterhood offers the party a three job contract to investigate three weather control facilities that the elvish druids created in the region.
The Sisters believe that these sites are failing and causing chaotic weather throughout the region.</p>
<p>The first of these three sites that the party investigates is the Forge of Fury, deep in the dwarves region of the mountains.
In order to get access to the facility, the party first makes their way to Domov, where they encounter Loreia, an artificer apprenticing with the dwarves.</p>
<p>The facility is guarded by sentient plant and rock based creatures, but the party ultimately reaches the research facility where the druids lived and worked.
Making their way through these defenses, the party finds Duke Nowak, the paramour of King Banik.
The party find and frees a powerful Fey lord, the Smith, who destroys the magic that the druids were using to control the weather from this site.
As they explore the remains of the facility, the party angers another dragon and finds a living, collapsible fortress.</p>
<p>As the party makes their way back to Domov, there is an assassination attempt on Duke Nowak.
The party travels through the ley lines to reach Domov quickly and attempt to stop a coup attempt by Queen Jusic.
The dwarves are grateful for the help but demand that the party leaves immediately so they can sort out their political issues without outside interference.
Loreia stays with the dwarves, but Daestra rejoins the party.</p>

<section id="id7">
<h3>Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The party begins the long journey to the Adventuring Academy by traveling around the Fey forest.
Along the way, they encounter a bit of trouble.</p>
<p>At a local farm down the road from Kalkum, the party is hired by a local farmer to investigate their missing daughter.
The farmer’s family has been leaving offerings to local forest spirits for years, but the farmer’s wife recently stopped because of the scarcity of supplies due to the weather.
Soon after the wife stopped leaving the offerings, their daughter was taken and replaced with a unnerving duplicate.</p>
<p>The party found a local forest spirit and this spirit lead them to the Temple of the Restful Lily.
This site used to be run by Nertha, a local fey and the daughter of two gods, but she was trapped by three hags.
These hags have been preying upon locals and stole the daughter under some dubious interpretation of the original deal between Nertha and the farmer’s family.
The party freed Nertha and killed the hags.</p>
<p>The party returned the daughter and received a promissory note for supplies from the Friends in exchange.
Upon learning that the farmer was a banker for the Friends, Daestra threatened him.
He fled into the night with his family, faking their deaths by burning down the farm.</p>
<p>Further down the road the party runs into a large encampment of Sisters.
The Sisters offer the party a ‘smash and grab’ contract where the only compensation is any treasure they recover and the party accepts.</p>
<p>The party makes their way to a manufactured shrine that a minor fey was attempting to use to bolster his reputation in an attempt to make himself seem more powerful.
While investigating the bodies of a verse of Sisters that were originally sent to this shrine, the party fell into a large, subterranean temple complex.
After making their way through a series of traps and monsters, the party encounters the minor fey who created this dungeon.
He offers to make the party his champions, and the party declines, instead choosing to kill him.</p>
<p>As they prepare to leave the temple complex, the party again encounters the Smith, who agrees to enhance their weapons and armor in exchange for the party pulling him out of the magical rift in the Forge of Fury.</p>
<p>Upon their return to the Sisters encampment, the party is surprised by the sudden arrival of Sister Elisabeth from the ruling council of the Sisterhood.
She declares that due to the party’s skill and deeds, the Sisterhood recognizes the party as a partner organization striving for stability and prosperity in the region.
Ora is elevated in rank as the Sister’s ambassador to the party and the Sisters agree to give in-kind help to the party in the field.</p>

<h3>Summary:<a class="headerlink" href="#id10" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A bodyguard for an Astralnaut of the Illithid Empire was separated from his change in a planar travel mishap.
He asked the party to help him recover his missing charge, and in the process the party discovers a colony of mimics that is being oppressed by the Friends in conjunction with Illithid criminals.
The party saved the mimic colony and the Astral scientist that the bodyguard is responsible for.</p>
<p>Upon return, this scientist revealed that the party has an Astral ship.
The ship was designed by the elves that lived in this region before the cataclysmic accident that separated this realm from the Astral sea and the rest of the realms.
Criminal groups in the Illithid Empire would like to locate old technology to use as weapons of mass destruction to recreate the cataclysm to destroy the Empire.</p>
