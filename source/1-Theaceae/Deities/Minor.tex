The general theory of apotheosis proposed by many scholars in the region proposes that the deities posses the ability to split pieces of themselves off to produce less powerful deities.
She is believed to have done this to create Nature and Tempest, Knowledge and Forge.

This power is believed to be inherited by these four deities, and from time to time these deities sunder elements of themselves.
These sundered elements become minor deities in their own right, from Fey lords and ladies, to eldritch beings and minor gods.

One of these notable entities is Testa, a sundered shard of Knowledge that has a strong local cult following.
