Massive outdoor botanical gardens is one of the most breathtaking sights in all of the settlements on the Dry Side.
The botanical gardens contain an astonishing array of plants that grow nowhere else in Theaceae, ranging from tropical ferns and massive flowers to aromatic herbs.

Marion Werner (human woman, monk) is friendly but direct.
She only accepts visitors in the gardens and expects any visitors, regardless of station, to help with maintenance and care of the gardens.
Marion always has small jobs to test the capabilities of adventurers.
