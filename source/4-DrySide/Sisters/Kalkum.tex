Kalkum is the stronghold of the Sisters, and all new Sisters are trained here.
Several nearby villages trade food and supplies for protection, but the citadel strives to one day become self sufficient.

The Sisters only require dedication to good, but most of the Sisters worship the siblings of order.
Adherents of Knowledge tend to look after the expansive libraries and medical facilities of the Sisters, while adherents of Forge tend to join the more militant organizations of the Sisters.
There are extensive facilities in Kalkum supporting both the charitable and combative aims of the Sisters.
