The outlying areas around Kalkum contain a variety of small farms and villages that support the Sisters.

One of these villages contains a small community of elves that often send their girl children to join the Sisters.
Of note in this community, there is a retired elf Archdruid that goes by the name of Josie.
The party can buy potions or training from Josie.
