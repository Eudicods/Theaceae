At the heart of town is the Wolff Trading Post, the nexus of trade between the dry side and the East side.
The trading post stocks the gear found on the Adventuring Gear table in the Player's Handbook, at the listed prices.
Food and rations cost double the listed price.

Tirza Wolff (human woman, commoner) is the latest member of the Wolff family to operate the Wolff Trading Post.
She is friendly but businesslike, always happy to help new travelers who are preparing to head into the dry side for the first time.
Tirza always has some work available for friendly faces that she trusts.
