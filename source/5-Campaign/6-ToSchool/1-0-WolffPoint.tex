The party is one week of travel away from Wolff Point, the last major town between Kalkum and the Adventuring Academy.

Tirza Wolff, owner of Wolff Trading Post, has a dead, exsanguinated goat for the party.
Sister Amelia has a communication pouch for the party.
Balris Grirlei, owner of the Majestic Badger, has been told to be on the lookout for the party and set them a trap.

The Friends want to trap the party inside of an extradimensional space.
Between burning down the homes of one of the Friends bankers and foiling the plans of the new allies of the Friends, the group has set a bounty on the party.
The extradimensional trap is set inside of a book disguised to look like a red book of the elves.
