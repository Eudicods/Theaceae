The party has three main threats, the Death Knight, the Archmage, and the Dracolich.
The Mother of Dragons will focus upon the Dracolich and the party plans to start with the Archmage before going after the Death Knight.
The Mother of Dragons will immediately go after the Dracolich, which will likely get the attention of the Death Knight.
After the first of the Death Knight or the Archmage dies, the other will go on a suicide change against the rest of the party.
