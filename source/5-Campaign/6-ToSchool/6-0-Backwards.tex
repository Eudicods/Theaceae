The party successfully escaped the Friend's extradimensional headquarters and took their house back to Kalkum.
Unfortunately, navigation of the ley lines is difficult and they landed one week away from Kalkum.

Once the party makes their way back to Kalkum, they will have the ability to collect some intelligence:

* The Sisters have had a mysterious group recovering captured Sisters from Fey POW camps and receiving rewards for their return

* The Sisters would appreciate anyone who can investigate this mysterious group

* The Sisters have had to reinforce their vaults from magical intruders who can walk through walls

* The Adenturing Academy has reported similar theft of dangeous items

* The Sisters are in negotiations with the Illithid Empire for food

* The Sisters suspect that the Friends are conducting similar negotiations with other groups from the Astra Sea for food to turn into political and financial capital
