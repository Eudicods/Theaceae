There is a skill check to determine how long it takes the party to reach Shadowdusk based upon stealth and survival.
The party may choose to take twice as long for advantage on a stealth check.

Once the party reaches Shadowdusk, they will encounter Melissara and Derrion Shadowdusk.
Melissara will reveal that the captured Sisters are being held on the bottom level.
She is willing to let the party take the Sisters, but they must first kill Zalthar and Dezmyr Shadowdusk, as well as their dracolich.
