The party was surrounded by assassins and took refuge in their magical house.
Overnight, while the party rested, the assassins surrounded the house with traps in preparation for the morning.

However, when the party was researching options for escape, they accidentally triggered a magical trap left in the supplies given to them by the Friends.
This trap malfunctioned, and the party was shrunk and transported into an extradimensional mansion that the Friends leadership uses to meet.

The archwizard Wahn, leader of one of the factions of Friends, encountered the party but mistook them for new recruits.
His imp, Fistandia, is willing to help the party escape in exchange for releasing the mimic in the basement of the mansion.
He will show the party a control device for the house and will shrink it down to their size for their use.
