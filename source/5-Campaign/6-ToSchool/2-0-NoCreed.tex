This is the last session for Creed.
The end goal of the session is for Creed to ride off into the sunset with his food cart, working for the Lord of the Hunt.

One week out from Wolff Point, the party will be stopped on the road by an Ent.
This Ent will ask the party to save a pair of dryads that have been captured by a hag.

The hag captured the dryads because they were planning on disrupting her plans to summon a mighty beast to take over this portion of the forest.
She has left the dryads guarded by grells.

The hag completes the ritual as the party arrives.
The beast is too much to handle, but the Lord of the Hunt will arrive to help finish it off and assert his claim over Creed's services.
