^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Summary:

The party met in Camellia as members of the same caravan over the White Spine mountains.
Before they left, the head of the Tealeaf family, one of the big tea growing families in the region, offered to pay the party for news or the safety of her son, Finkas Tealeaf.
Before the party leaves Camellia for the dry side of the mountains, they are attacked by a group from the Friends, a local criminal organization, who try to dissuade the party from looking for Finkas.

The party followed Finkas's trail into the Fey forest, where they are trapped by a Fey lord, the Lord of the Hunt.
They discover that Finkas has been captured by agents of another Fey lord, the Master of Whispers, and they negotiate with the Lord of the Hunt for permission to leave and find Finkas in exchange for a favor.

The party finds Finkas at an ancient weather control facility which was constructed by the elvish druids that used to reign in this region.
During the effort to rescue Finkas, he is poisoned and dies.
A verse of the Sisterhood, a local order of religious scholars and warriors, encounter the party on a patrol through the Fey forest, and they offer to trade the party favors - the verse of Sisters assumes the favor owed to the Lord of the Hunt and the party agrees to do a job for the Sisters.

Roland leaves the party to return to Camellia and inform the Tealeaf family of Finkas's fate while the rest of the party heads to Kalkum, the headquarters of the Sisterhood.

In order to get access to the facility, the party first makes their way to Domov, where they encounter Loreia, an artificer apprenticing with the dwarves.

Act IV - Forest Travels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Summary:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The party begins the long journey to the Adventuring Academy by traveling around the Fey forest.
Along the way, they encounter a bit of trouble.

At a local farm down the road from Kalkum, the party is hired by a local farmer to investigate their missing daughter.
The farmer's family has been leaving offerings to local forest spirits for years, but the farmer's wife recently stopped because of the scarcity of supplies due to the weather.
Soon after the wife stopped leaving the offerings, their daughter was taken and replaced with a unnerving duplicate.

The party found a local forest spirit and this spirit lead them to the Temple of the Restful Lily.
This site used to be run by Nertha, a local fey and the daughter of two gods, but she was trapped by three hags.
These hags have been preying upon locals and stole the daughter under some dubious interpretation of the original deal between Nertha and the farmer's family.
The party freed Nertha and killed the hags.

The party returned the daughter and received a promissory note for supplies from the Friends in exchange.
Upon learning that the farmer was a banker for the Friends, Daestra threatened him.
He fled into the night with his family, faking their deaths by burning down the farm.

Further down the road the party runs into a large encampment of Sisters.
The Sisters offer the party a 'smash and grab' contract where the only compensation is any treasure they recover and the party accepts.

The party makes their way to a manufactured shrine that a minor fey was attempting to use to bolster his reputation in an attempt to make himself seem more powerful.
While investigating the bodies of a verse of Sisters that were originally sent to this shrine, the party fell into a large, subterranean temple complex.
After making their way through a series of traps and monsters, the party encounters the minor fey who created this dungeon.
He offers to make the party his champions, and the party declines, instead choosing to kill him.

As they prepare to leave the temple complex, the party again encounters the Smith, who agrees to enhance their weapons and armor in exchange for the party pulling him out of the magical rift in the Forge of Fury.

Upon their return to the Sisters encampment, the party is surprised by the sudden arrival of Sister Elisabeth from the ruling council of the Sisterhood.
She declares that due to the party's skill and deeds, the Sisterhood recognizes the party as a partner organization striving for stability and prosperity in the region.
Ora is elevated in rank as the Sister's ambassador to the party and the Sisters agree to give in-kind help to the party in the field.

Resuming their journey, the party encounters two new members on the road, the rogue Lilth and an enchanted skull, Bob.
Their arrival coincides with the party meeting a strange traveler on the road who they believe is Trickster.
Soon thereafter, the party meets a group of monk-assassins, who have a contract on the party but offer to let Ekdos go free if he leaves the party within the next 24 hours.

Because this is very new for the party, they decide to teleport in the direction of safety and go towards Kalkum.

Act VIII - Undead Druids
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Summary:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In the desert, the party found a set of 8 standing stones.
These standing stones teleported them into the Doomvault, a facility manned and powered by undead druids.
A resurected druid who was disgruntled with undead life told the party that they needed to disrupt 6 black gates to be able to get to the heart of the Doomvault and disable the facility.
The party took his key and started making their way through the various chambers towards their goal.

The party managed to disable one black gate, but they retreated in the face of a powerful enemy that was too much for them.
This enemy followed the party back to the undead druid's fighting arena, and the party disguised themselves as pit fighters.
During this fight, the party met and saved a ex-Sister who told them about a dragon being held captive in another part of the Doomvault.
The party managed to free the dragon and send him back to Kalkum for rest and recuperation.

Working their way through the dungeon, the party found and disabled an additional three black gates.
As they were making their way towards a fifth black gate to disable, the party discovered a portal that lead to a distant Gith military facility that held dragons captive and trained them as mounts for combat.
The party agreed to free these dragons, but this negotiation was complicated by rumors that the Sister leadership in Kalkum was aware of this subjugation of dragons and hoping to use these forces to defeat various enemies.

As the party explores the asteroid, they discover a group of rebel Gith prisoners.
These prisoners agree to work with the party to free the dragons and destroy the garrison on the asteroid.
During this effort, the party takes a long rest in the treeship, only to discover that the ship was build to explore the Astral Sea and wants to 'go now'.
After convincing the ship, named Cerasus, to return to the asteroid, the rebel Gith mention that they are impressed at the party's antique ship and may have some individuals back at their base who can repair or upgrade the treeship.

Back on the asteroid, the party has to rush to finish destroying the rods before the Gith garrison can escape on a supply ship that has docked.
The party killed the remaining garrison forces and secured the ship, but the rebel Gith died in the process, leaving the party responsible for the orphans.
Ultimately, one of the children stole the supply ship and Ada's powers before running off with the rest of the children.
The dragons left through the portal back to Theaceae when the party left the asteroid to return to the Doomvault.

After returning to the Doomvault, the party was immediately stopped by an Aboleth.
This Aboleth offered to give the party the last gate key they needed in exchange for recovering an arcane stone.
Various monsters attempted to interfere, to include a Beholder, but the party sucessfully recovered the stone.
This stone allowed the Aboleth to grow and exit the dungeon.

After securing the last key, the party was able to make their way to the core of the Doomvault to disable the facility.
They got a promise of help from a necromancer who ultimately took an object from the subvaults in the core of the facility and disappeared.
As the core of the Doomvault collapsed upon itself, the party found themselves in a field full of tea leaves on the opposite side of the mountains.
