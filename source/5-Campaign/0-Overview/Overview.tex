Before they left, the head of the Tealeaf family, one of the big tea growing families in the region, offered to pay the party for news or the safety of her son, Finkas Tealeaf.
Before the party leaves Camellia for the dry side of the mountains, they are attacked by a group from the Friends, a local criminal organization, who try to dissuade the party from looking for Finkas.

The party followed Finkas's trail into the Fey forest, where they are trapped by a Fey lord, the Lord of the Hunt.
They discover that Finkas has been captured by agents of another Fey lord, the Master of Whispers, and they negotiate with the Lord of the Hunt for permission to leave and find Finkas in exchange for a favor.

The party finds Finkas at an ancient weather control facility which was constructed by the elvish druids that used to reign in this region.
During the effort to rescue Finkas, he is poisoned and dies.
A verse of the Sisterhood, a local order of religious scholars and warriors, encounter the party on a patrol through the Fey forest, and they offer to trade the party favors - the verse of Sisters assumes the favor owed to the Lord of the Hunt and the party agrees to do a job for the Sisters.

Act IV - Forest Travels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Summary:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The party begins the long journey to the Adventuring Academy by traveling around the Fey forest.
Along the way, they encounter a bit of trouble.

At a local farm down the road from Kalkum, the party is hired by a local farmer to investigate their missing daughter.
The farmer's family has been leaving offerings to local forest spirits for years, but the farmer's wife recently stopped because of the scarcity of supplies due to the weather.
Soon after the wife stopped leaving the offerings, their daughter was taken and replaced with a unnerving duplicate.

The party found a local forest spirit and this spirit lead them to the Temple of the Restful Lily.
This site used to be run by Nertha, a local fey and the daughter of two gods, but she was trapped by three hags.
These hags have been preying upon locals and stole the daughter under some dubious interpretation of the original deal between Nertha and the farmer's family.
The party freed Nertha and killed the hags.

The party returned the daughter and received a promissory note for supplies from the Friends in exchange.
Upon learning that the farmer was a banker for the Friends, Daestra threatened him.
He fled into the night with his family, faking their deaths by burning down the farm.

Further down the road the party runs into a large encampment of Sisters.
The Sisters offer the party a 'smash and grab' contract where the only compensation is any treasure they recover and the party accepts.

The party makes their way to a manufactured shrine that a minor fey was attempting to use to bolster his reputation in an attempt to make himself seem more powerful.
While investigating the bodies of a verse of Sisters that were originally sent to this shrine, the party fell into a large, subterranean temple complex.
After making their way through a series of traps and monsters, the party encounters the minor fey who created this dungeon.
He offers to make the party his champions, and the party declines, instead choosing to kill him.

As they prepare to leave the temple complex, the party again encounters the Smith, who agrees to enhance their weapons and armor in exchange for the party pulling him out of the magical rift in the Forge of Fury.

Upon their return to the Sisters encampment, the party is surprised by the sudden arrival of Sister Elisabeth from the ruling council of the Sisterhood.
She declares that due to the party's skill and deeds, the Sisterhood recognizes the party as a partner organization striving for stability and prosperity in the region.
Ora is elevated in rank as the Sister's ambassador to the party and the Sisters agree to give in-kind help to the party in the field.

Ultimately, Creed agrees to go with the Lord of the Hunt and become his personal chef in exchange for the Lord of the Hunt stopping the Pheonix.

Resuming their journey, the party encounters two new members on the road, the rogue Lilth and an enchanted skull, Bob.
Their arrival coincides with the party meeting a strange traveler on the road who they believe is Trickster.
Soon thereafter, the party meets a group of monk-assassins, who have a contract on the party but offer to let Ekdos go free if he leaves the party within the next 24 hours.
The assassins attack the party in the middle of the night and the party takes refuge in the house.

During the night, the assassins create an elaborate series of traps outside of the house.
While investigating a possible escape, Daestra opens a book that was in the bundle of supplies received from the Friends and suddenly the party is transported to the extra-dimensional headquarters of the Friends.
Unfortunately, the party is also shrunk to one tenth of their size.
The party meets archwizard Wahn, leader of one of the factions of Friends, who mistakes them for a prank or potential apprentices.
Wahn's familiar offers to help the party escape if they cause chaos by releasing a mimic in Wahn's workshop.

The party gains a helm that lets them control the house and teleport it to ley line intersections.
Because this is very new for the party, they decide to teleport in the direction of safety and go towards Kalkum.
They unfortunately miss their mark by a small amount and have to walk a week to reach Kalkum.

In Kalkum, the party receives new information about a mysterious group that is rescuing Sisters from Fey capture and returning them for a reward.
The party sees a group of these dark cloaked strangers and agrees to help them rescue a group of Sisters held at a particularly dangerous location.

The party travels with ten of these cloaked strangers to a old elven mansion deep underground in the Fey Forest.
The husband and wife that own the mansion agree to release the Sisters they are holding captive if the party kills their brother and sister down on the third level of the mansion, as well as their Dracolich.
After some initial reconnaissance, the party gets a map of the third level.

Act VIII - Undead Druids
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Summary:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In the desert, the party found a set of 8 standing stones.
These standing stones teleported them into the Doomvault, a facility manned and powered by undead druids.
A resurrected druid who was disgruntled with undead life told the party that they needed to disrupt 6 black gates to be able to get to the heart of the Doomvault and disable the facility.
The party took his key and started making their way through the various chambers towards their goal.

The party managed to disable one black gate, but they retreated in the face of a powerful enemy that was too much for them.
This enemy followed the party back to the undead druid's fighting arena, and the party disguised themselves as pit fighters.
During this fight, the party met and saved a ex-Sister who told them about a dragon being held captive in another part of the Doomvault.
The party managed to free the dragon and send him back to Kalkum for rest and recuperation.

Working their way through the dungeon, the party found and disabled an additional three black gates.
As they were making their way towards a fifth black gate to disable, the party discovered a portal that lead to a distant Gith military facility that held dragons captive and trained them as mounts for combat.
The party agreed to free these dragons, but this negotiation was complicated by rumors that the Sister leadership in Kalkum was aware of this subjugation of dragons and hoping to use these forces to defeat various enemies.

As the party explores the asteroid, they discover a group of rebel Gith prisoners.
These prisoners agree to work with the party to free the dragons and destroy the garrison on the asteroid.
During this effort, the party takes a long rest in the treeship, only to discover that the ship was build to explore the Astral Sea and wants to 'go now'.
After convincing the ship, named Cerasus, to return to the asteroid, the rebel Gith mention that they are impressed at the party's antique ship and may have some individuals back at their base who can repair or upgrade the treeship.

Back on the asteroid, the party has to rush to finish destroying the rods before the Gith garrison can escape on a supply ship that has docked.
The party killed the remaining garrison forces and secured the ship, but the rebel Gith died in the process, leaving the party responsible for the orphans.
Ultimately, one of the children stole the supply ship and Ada's powers before running off with the rest of the children.
The dragons left through the portal back to Theaceae when the party left the asteroid to return to the Doomvault.

After returning to the Doomvault, the party was immediately stopped by an Aboleth.
This Aboleth offered to give the party the last gate key they needed in exchange for recovering an arcane stone.
Various monsters attempted to interfere, to include a Beholder, but the party successfully recovered the stone.
This stone allowed the Aboleth to grow and exit the dungeon.

After securing the last key, the party was able to make their way to the core of the Doomvault to disable the facility.
They got a promise of help from a necromancer who ultimately took an object from the subvaults in the core of the facility and disappeared.
As the core of the Doomvault collapsed upon itself, the party found themselves in a field full of tea leaves on the opposite side of the mountains.

Act XI - Stop the Cult
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Summary:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The party has made their way back to Camillia to find the trail of the cult.
It takes the party 3 weeks to eventually find rumors linking the cult and the ghost town of Croatoa.
The party finds, Mayhem, a local adventurer who can guide them to Croatoa.

The party teleports to Douro to start the long journey through the jungle to Croatoa.
While in Douro, Daestra visits the grave of her brother only to discover that the entire graveyard has been emptied and the part of town where the cult used to live has been abandoned.
Daestra travels underground to discover an abandoned temple of the cult guarded by ghosts from the graveyard where her brother possesses her body.
The party is able to put her brother's spirit to rest and resume their journey to Croatoa.

It takes 6 weeks to travel to Croatoa.
On the way, the party regularly encounters Gnolls; near one particularly large group of Gnolls the party finds a tower that is glowing with a strange green light.
This tower seems to curse people to painful hunger.
An elf that was trapped in a prison mirror inside of the tower told the party this this tower was part of the old teraforming efforts.
The party collapsed the tower, which stopped the curse.

Upon arriving in Croatoa, the party discovered that the town's inhabitants are trapped in a gap between dimensions.
The townspeople are invisible during the daylight and unable to interact with their home dimension.
In three days time the new moon will bring an attack of creatures from one of the rift's neighboring dimensions, and pirates are scheduled to bring supplies for the cult on the following day.

The party escaped Croatoa by taking the portal to the Astral Sea from the nearby underwater ruins and activating it inside of Croatoa.
The portal misfired due to being in the inter-dimensional rift, but it took the party safely to Skullport.
The party was able to negotiate safe passage out of Skullport and used the tree to return to the nearest lay line intersection to Croatoa.
This intersection happened to be on the Sea Dogs ship that was bringing supplies to the cult.

After negotiating with the Sea Dogs, the party was able to come ashore and disguise themselves as new recruits for the cult.
The cultists accepting the supplies lead the party to the part of the jungle where the cult has been hiding.
At the entry to the new demiplane that the cult is creating, the cultists were attacked by people who were mutated by exposure to abhorrent monsters during cult ceremonies.
One of these people is Vikzhel, a healer and former member of the cult who knew Daestra when she was younger.
He helps the party take a shortcut through Testa's dimension in order to stealthily reach the hunting lodge the cult is using as its headquarters.

The party successfully surprised the guards and lit the bottom floor of the hunting lodge on fire.
Half of the party attacked the Gith child inhabited by Testa while the rest retrieved artifacts and kept the cult at bay.
The Gith child was wearing the necklace that Ada used to wear.
Destroying this necklace and severely damaging the body holding Testa triggered a massive explosion that pulled Testa, the surrounding area, and the cult into an isolated pocket dimension, forever trapping Testa.
Daestra sacrificed herself to make sure her mother was trapped in this pocket dimension, while the rest of the party was ejected into a random asteroid in the Astral Sea.

Summary:

The party was ejected into a random asteroid in the Astral Sea.
They found themselves on a small asteroid being used for smuggled goods.
On this asteroid, they met Shawn and CUTIEPIE.

Shawn took the party back to an asteroid base for smugglers that he works with.
There, after some tense missteps with CUTIEPIE's identification of potential threats, the party agreed to take out Jewl Vertona, an Illithid that was psychically poisioning a child, Reoma.

The party headed to the cityship Vertona.
During the docking process, they saw a huge Imperial fleet, and the flagship had a massive red dragon tied down on its deck.
The party met Divonia, who is willing to fix Sara in exchange for rumors about the massive red dragon.

Below the surface, the party met Reomo, the brother of Reoma and leader in a group of anti-empire rebels.
He was dating Jewl before she became an Illithid, and her soul is trapped inside of a ring of mind shielding, which allows her to occasionally take over the body of the Illithid.
The party executed some thefts in order to get enough diamonds to kill and resurrect Jewl, but they were betrayed by the rebels.

The attempt to resurrect Jewl failed, but her soul was preserved in the ring.
The party fights their way to the surface to escape.

The underwater river that runs by his druid grove began steadily decreasing in level over the last month, and several Gith corpses floated by.
The party investigated and discovered a Gith raiding party that was attempting to set up a suitable location for an Elder Brain.
They party defeated the raiding party and destroyed the small base.

Act XIV - Raid the Shadow Monks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Summary:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The party met Sister Agnus's wizard ally, Wahn.
Wahn needs some supplies for his arcane device to isolate this realm from the Astral Sea.

The first task the party takes on is helping negotiations between the Dragon Mother and Sister Agnus to ensure that the Dragon Mother will permit this device being constructed.
The party delivered messages between the Dragon Mother and Sister Agnus while finding other work to do in the meantime.
While handling these side tasks, the party discovered shapeshifters attempting to infiltrate the dragon city.
They captured the shapeshifters ship and repaired it.
