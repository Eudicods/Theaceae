The party will meet the current caretaker of the library, an old elven druid who is near death.
The library has been his charge since the city was destroyed, but the strain of maintaining the magic has been too great for him, and the library sent out messages and dreams in an effort to find a new caretaker.

He Who Dreams will have the opportunity to participate in three challenges, one each of plants, animals, and nature, and if he succeeds, the library will accept him as the new caretaker.
