The party decided to approach the old dorms and caves.
This part of the library has the werbats, which the party encountered.

After two members contracted lycanthropy, the party started working on a cure.
In order to create this cure, the party needs to gather ingredients and spend several days brewing the potions.
The werbats in the library would like to get access to this cure at any cost.
