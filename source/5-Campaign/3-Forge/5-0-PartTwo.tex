The party has largely cleared the first level of the Forge of Fury.
After a frontal assault on the facility, the party opted to find a hidden passage and make a loud, frontal assault after finding the plant-men laying in wait for them.
The plant druid managed to flee, burning the bridge behind them.
This battle left the party fairly beat up and they elected to long rest on the east side of the chasm.
