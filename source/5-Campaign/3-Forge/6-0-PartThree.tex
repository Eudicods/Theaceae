The party found Duke Nowak, the political and romantic rival of the Queen.
After disabling the security system on the first level, the party made their way down onto the second level of the dungeon.
On this level, the party discovered a tribe of sentient rock people who were originally part of the security system of the dungeon.
The tribe of rock people provided some information about the heart of the druid facility and how the magical rift works.
