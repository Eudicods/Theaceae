The party has been tasked by the Duke to help save the city from the civil war.
There are two main objectives that the Duke sees as important are

* Save King Banik from the attacking forces

* Capture Queen Jusic to prevent future insurrections

How the party accomplishes these tasks will be interesting to observe.
