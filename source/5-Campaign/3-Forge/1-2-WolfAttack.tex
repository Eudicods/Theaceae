As the party makes their way towards Domov, they have an encounter with wolves.
The mountains sometimes have packs of Wolves.
A few of these packs of Wolves are lead by Winter Wolves.

With a DC 15 perception check, the party notices blood smears from a dwarf scouting party that encountered this wolf pack.
The pack of Wolves will stay out of sight of the party and wait until the cover of night to attack the party.

The Wolf pack is being hunted by a patrol of dwarves lead by a member of the Jusic family.
This captain does not know about the details of the agreement between the Sisters and the Banik family.
