Last week the party found the rift to the Feywild.
This rift was being held open by a fey lord wedged inside.
The party almost died fighting the security system on this level of the dungeon, but the fey lord, Siebold The Smith, burned out the plants fighting the party.
Once Siebold The Smith left, the party started clearing the remaining areas of the dungeon.
