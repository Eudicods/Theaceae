The party managed to clear the remains of the hags' tower and earned the favor of Nertha.

The party learned that the Fey forest is literally pieces of the Fey realm, and these pieces, along with their Fey, have been trapped this realm and unable to return to their home.

Upon the return, the party was invited into the back shed of the farmer.
He gave the party 1000 gold in trade or materiel, to be collected from any Friends banker.
At this point, the party is unsure if they are starting to become ailed with the Friends.

One of the party members threatened the farmer and threatened to kill him if the farmer did not tell his wife about his involvement with the friends.
In response, the farmer burned down his farmhouse and escaped.

One week further down the road towards Wolff Point, the Sisters have set up a checkpoint along the road.
The Sisters there will recognize any Sisters among the party and send them on a mission to check up on the lost Sisters encampment set up in the Fey woods.
