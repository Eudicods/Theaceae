The party has discovered a farm where the child of the farmers has gone missing.
After some investigation, they discovered that the original owner of the farm made a deal with local spirits to leave offerings of milk and honey out in exchange for prosperity.
The wife had been taking the milk in to feed the baby.
The party believes that the baby was stolen because the family was no longer making the offerings.
