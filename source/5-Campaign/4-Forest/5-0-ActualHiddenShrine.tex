The trajectory of the session took a bit of a detour last time.
The party reached the Sisters encampment and checkpoint along the road to Wolff Point.

The parcty accepted the job to determine what happened to the Sisters team that was exploring a relatively new temple to a Fey that is trying to accrue followers as a deity of the undead.
The ruins themselves are not terribly interesting to the party because they are so young, but the party has accepted the job in the interest of maintaining good relations with the Sisters.
