The party found their way through a mysterious invisible maze and made their way to a seemingly abandoned stone structure in the woods.
The structure transforms into a beautiful spa resort in the middle of a grove.

The spa was built by Nertha, the child of Nature and Forge.
It was once in a protected grove in the Fey realm, but the actions of the druids pulled this grove, along with other pieces of the Fey realm, into the mortal plane.
This lead to Nertha's powers slowly fading.

Nertha made a deal with the local farmer's family - some worship gave her some power to protect her small surviving group of followers.
Unfortunately, this was not enough, and a small coven of three fey hags was able to curse Nertha to become a Medusa.
They took over her spa and turned it into their lair.

Once the family failed to meet their bargain, one of the hags stole the baby and was looking to use the baby to increase her magic.

Half of the party decided to pay to stay in the spa while the other half explored the exterior of the resort.
