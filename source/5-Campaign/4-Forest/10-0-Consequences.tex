Last session the party escaped the dungeon.
They managed to find their way out of the bottom level and into the small upper level.
Once there, they located, surprised, turned to stone, and killed the minor fey that was running the dungeon.

The party has consequences for their approach, and this session will be largely role-playing focused.
The Smith will be coming to the temple to see what has happened before going inside to retrieve some weapons of his that this minor fey stole.
When the party makes their way back to the encampment, they will have a visit from the Sisters leadership, bestowing upon the party partner organization status, though this will require the party selecting a name for themselves.
