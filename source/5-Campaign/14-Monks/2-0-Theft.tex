The party has decided to handle the negotiations with the Dragon Mother first.
They will ferry messages back and forth between Sister Agnes and the dragons.
In the meantime, the Dragon Mother will request that the party takes on small tasks in the local area so it looks like their trips have another purpose.
The first task is handling accusations that Timmy's kids have been stealing from local business.
Shapeshifters are attempting to infiltrate the town and monitor the dragons.
