Hopefully the party will work towards resolution of the Gith and Sister army this session.

The party talked about the possibility of getting the Fey involved if they can move the forest or get the army to flee into the forest.
They also discussed getting as many tattoos as they could complete before the army arrived.

Ultimately, a portion of the town could be convinced to fight if the party presents a clear plan.
Others in town have already begun evacuating to Wolff Point or the new dragon city in the mountains.
