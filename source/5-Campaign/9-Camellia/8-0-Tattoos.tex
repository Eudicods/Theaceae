A patrol of Gith soldiers has taken residence at the Adventuring Academy to look for the Qith and dragons.
The party will need some plan to avoid the attention of this patrol.

Also ,the party will be able to pick their tattoos and determine how much time will be needed to get all of the tattoos.

Lastly, the party will receive information about where to find the lost library of the druids and how to get inside.
This will require the party jumping or traveling back to the mountains.
