Amelia will be very friendly with the party, especially Ora.
She will be insistent on two points - first that she needs to recover the body of her father and second that she wants to go to Kalkum to become a Sister.

Amelia does not know which way she came from and where her father is.
The party will need a DC 15 survival check to backtrace the path Amelia took as she was stumbling about, looking for someone.

Her father fell into an icy ravine.
The party will need a DC 20 athletics or acrobatics check to recover the body.
This can be mitigated with clever use of tools.

Once her father is located, she can lead the party back to her town, which is four days away.
