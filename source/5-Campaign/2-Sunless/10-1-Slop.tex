As the party makes their way into Kalkum, the weather starts vacillating.
The snow starts melting off and freezing, making a quagmire of slush and ice.

As soon as the party reaches the gates of Kalkum, they will be directed to the keep.
Sister Frida has an offer of a series of jobs for the party.
The change in the weather has rapidly increased the priority of understanding the cause of this volatility.
It will take the Sisters six weeks to gather the information, but they have leads on three old, lost ruins that they believe contains important pieces of the old terraforming system formed by the elvish druids.
The Sisters would like to hire the party as the most experienced archaeologists they currently have available.

The Sisters will pay 6,000 gp for visiting all three ruins; 1,000 gp for the first, 2,000 gp for the second, and 3,000 gp for the third.
The Sisters will allow limited access to library resources once they have collected their basic information at the end of six weeks.
