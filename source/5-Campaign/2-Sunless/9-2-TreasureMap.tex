The town is very thankful that the party recovered the body of Amelia's father.
They will happily give the party three days of rations each.

While the party is in town, a tinker is also visiting.
This tinker never stops moving, always pacing back and forth, never touching the same place twice.
If the party engages with the tinker, he is willing to sell them goods if they pace along with him.
The tinker will sell the party a treasure map if he believes that they are interesting or interested.

Following the treasure map will lead to a small cache of Friends equipment and supplies.
The bulk of the supplies are weapons, but there are some small artifacts worth 100 gp.
A small pack of wolves guard the cache of goods.
