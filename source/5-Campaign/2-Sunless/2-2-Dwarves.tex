It will take the party approximately two weeks to reach the ruins, provided that the weather holds and they do not encounter any problems.
This is an opportunity for the party to get to know one another.

Once the party makes it into the mountains, they will find themselves stalked by Dwarves.
A perception check of 20 will detect these Dwaves who are monitoring the party.
After 2 days of observations, the Dwarves will confront the party and ask them why they are here.
They will warn off the party from visiting any mines or taking any minerals.
