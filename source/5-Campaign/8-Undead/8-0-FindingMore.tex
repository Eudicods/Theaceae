The party discovered that the Sister had gone through the portal and found a second portal to a distant location.
This second portal led to a far realm with some sort of dragon's lair.

The only dragon that could speak Common was an adult red dragon who claimed she made a deal with the Sister - the Sister would free her children from the influence of the Gith in exchange for the dragon burning a city of her enemies down.
The dragon isn't too particular about who fulfills this deal, and she is even more eager to be reunited with the dragon mother, whom the party has met.

The rogue Sister claims that the Sister leadership in Kalkum is aware that the Illithid Empire enslaves dragons and wants to use these forces to subjugate any opposition to their rule.
