When securing the room with crabs, the party found a portal underneath one of the pools.
The Sister they saved went through this portal on unknown business while the party was not looking.

When she returned, the party confronted her; however, their interogation was disrupted by the rest of the party finding and disturbing a group of shark people in the next room.
