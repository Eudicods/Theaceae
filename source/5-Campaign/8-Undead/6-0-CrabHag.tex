The intervening dungeon rooms held various monsters, most of which the party was able to avoid.
There were a few traps that could not be avoided, but the party mananged to make their way through these fights and disable several more black gates.

Their efforts culminated in them reaching a hag in control of several large crabs.
The hag offered to trade help for control over this portion of the dungeon, but she was killed by the party.
