Ultimately, the party fought their way deeper into the cave and found the Astral scientist and four other victims.
It seems that the Friends were working with Illithid criminals to prepare people for consuming their memories as a delicacy among certain groups of Illithids.

The party took the young mimic back to the colony and helped with funeral rites for the mimics that were killed by the Illithids while the party was freeing the child and the captives.
After staying overnight at the site of the mimic colony, the party went back to the road and their portable house.

Upon return, this scientist revealed that the party has an Astral ship.
The ship was designed by the elves that lived in this region before the cataclysmic accident that separated this realm from the Astral sea and the rest of the realms.
Criminal groups in the Illithid Empire would like to locate old technology to use as weapons of mass destruction to recreate the cataclysm to destroy the Empire.
