The party dug deeper into the mystery of the sticky town and discovered that they are a colony of mimics being coerced by some mind flayers.
The mimics allowed the party to stay in the town overnight.
In the morning, the party went in the direction of a cave where the traveling companion of the Astral traveler was being held.
In route to the cave, the party was attacked by strange creatures in the forest that detected their footfalls.
