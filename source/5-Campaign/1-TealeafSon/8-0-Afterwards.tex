The party has had a rough plot arc.
This session will be straightforward and will give them a chance to adjust to the last 7 sessions.
The primary goal of the session is to provide for cross party role-playing opportunities.

The goals for the session are:

* Reach Wolff Point and collect the reward

* Leave for Kalkum and the Sisters

Early next session will start with the Sisters and their mission for the party.
