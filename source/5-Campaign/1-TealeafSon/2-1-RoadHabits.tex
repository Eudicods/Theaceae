The caravan differs in some ways, like using large trained goats instead of horses, but the caravan is otherwise unremarkable.
Devin Wagner is the caravan master.
The caravan consists of 5 wagons, 10 goats, 5 drivers, and 6 guards, with only the party as passengers.

The trip over the mountains will take roughly two weeks full of long, boring days.
The party will fall into some sort of a rhythm as they travel together.

This is a chance for the party to learn more about each other.

* Who tries to ride in the supply wagons vs walking
* What does everyone do as camp is set up or torn down
* Who does everyone talk to during the day or night
* How does everyone keep themselves busy during the day
