Once the party has resolved the conflict with the Cloaker, the Interrogator will come forth and try to finish off the party and escape.
Barring this, the Interrogator will try to manipulate the party into allegiance to the Master of Secrets.

The Interrogator knows:

* The warlock patron is a piece of Knowledge

* The ancient druids catalogued spells to help them terraform the region

* The connection between party members and the party

The Interrogator will try to leverage Finkas's life to help him escape and gain the allegiance of the party.
