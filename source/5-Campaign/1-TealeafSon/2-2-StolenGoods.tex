The ruins of Sinesis are a common stopping point for caravans headed over the mountains.
There will be some chance limited chance to explore the ruins, but if the party strays too far from camp, the head of the caravan will ask the party to stay closer.

In the middle of the night, the adventurers are woken up by screaming in the night and the sound of the angry goats breaking free.
A ghostly figure hovers over one of the guards for the caravan, who is shriveling as if he is having the life drained out of him.
One Specter per party member, minus one, attack the party.
Any sleeping members of the party will likely not be wearing armor.

After party fights off the Specters, they will find an ancient elven sword on the body of the guard.
The head of the caravan will explain that this guard must have snuck off to steal something from the ruins and removed the wrong item.
Some items in the ruins are guarded by spectral remnants of the former city watch.
The head of the caravan will explain that someone needs to return this sword to wherever this guard found it.
