A group of fey touched elves will be at the party.
Once they realize that the party is here to look for Finkas and his group, they will attempt to charm and lure away the party.

One by one, party members will make charasma saving throws.
Once party members have been charmed, they will try to convince other party members to talk the elves one by one and go with them.
