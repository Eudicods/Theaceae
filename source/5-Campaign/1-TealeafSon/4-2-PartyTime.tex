As the party is keeping watch overnight, a group of Satars come and invite the party to join them at a party.

The Satars

* do not know what happened to Finkas
* know lots of creatures and people will be at the party
* are confident that someone at the party will know something useful
* will not make promises but will assure the party
* "I'm sure x will be there/available/etc"

If the party does not join, they will be able to hear loud music from nearby.
The Satars are not confrontational or dangerous.

The party has a variety of activities, from dancing to gambling.
Party members that wish to participate in challenges will have skill challenges.
