The party has a flashback episode.
There are towers dotting what used to be the elven nation.
These towers were part of the terraforming efforts to make the land habitable.
This particular tower has malfunctioned and is contributing to the insatiable hunger that is characteristic of Gnolls.
Destroying this tower will help reduce the Gnoll threat in the area.
