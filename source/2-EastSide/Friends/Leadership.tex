The leadership of the Friends are the longest serving and most successful members.

Marquis Drach (elf man, drow shadowblade) is a deadly master assassin.
Assassinations are the rarest work that the Friends do, and this group among the Friends is the smallest.
However, under Drach's leadership, this faction has gained wide renown and fear.

Falcon (human man, champion) is a former pit fighter who became a thief.
He manages the largest number of Friends members, conducting basis thieving, adventuring, and protection jobs.

Wahn (human man, archmage) is a crazy, old, powerful mage.
He funds teams that collect old elven artifacts, and he keeps the best artifacts for himself before selling off or smuggling out the remaining ones.
Wahn is paranoid, spending large amounts of time and effort monitoring potential arcane rivals.

Agnes (human woman, war priest) is a former member of the Sisterhood Council who left over disagreements about the long term direction of the Sisterhood.
She works to recruit current Sisters to her teams.
These teams only do projection and monster slaying jobs, at much better prices than the Sisterhood offers.
