The Friends have access to a shared extradimensional manor that serves as their shared headquarters and meeting space.
Occasionally access may be granted to aids, but generally the access is restricted to leadership.

This extradimensional manor was stolen from a forgotten Archmage who inherited it from before the magical accident that impeded transdimensional travel.
