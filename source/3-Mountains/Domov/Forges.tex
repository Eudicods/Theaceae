Huge smithys dominate the bulk of the space in Domov.
These forges generate the metal trades goods that are so prized throughout the region.

A handful of these forges are fiercely protected and dedicated to artificing.
The rest will occasionally take on outside apprentices that show good promise.
These apprentices are highly valued blacksmiths when they graduate and their goods are almost as valued as the metalworked goods from the dwarves themselves.
