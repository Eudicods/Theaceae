A small clan of dwarves came to Theaceae roughly 1,000 years ago looking for gold and gems.
Instead of treasures, these dwarves found remarkably pure ore and mineral deposits.
Begrudgingly, the dwarves accepted this turn of fortune and became the most talented smiths in the region.
The ore is the key to their success, and they will fiercely guard their mines and drive off anyone who tries to mine in the White Spine mountains.

Small expeditions of dwarves can be found in the mountains, locating new veins of ore and starting small mines.
They are more than willing to trade with explorers that find their small mines, but they fiercely guard knowledge of the locations of their most valuable mines.
