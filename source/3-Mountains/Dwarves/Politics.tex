The dwarves are rules by a complex interconnected network of families.
Currently, the Banik family is the ruling family, and they claim to trace their lineage back to the founding of Domov.

The families will send their children to apprentice or page with other families to strengthen the bonds and alliances between the families.
This has lead to an interconnected web of alliances with a strong history of intrigue and scheming.

Because family names are important and the dwarves have developed some superstitions about the Fey in the region, first names are considered private.
Only close family members know first names, and dwarves are instead known by their title in their family.
Dwarves only change their title by improving it, leading to a whole series of 'retired honorifics' for elder family members.
