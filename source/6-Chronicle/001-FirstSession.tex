Day 2762
--------

The days were beginning to blur together again, the same as before I stumbled upon Ada.  We cannot recall how long ago that was.  We do not know what day it is.  It must be late summer.  The days are still warm, but the nights grow long and are beginning to chill.  The nights... It has been 2762 nights since I last slept.

But, today!  Today was… different.

We were gathering supplies to trek over the mountains in search of who knows what, when a flunkie of some local noble asked for volunteers for a lucrative and potentially hazardous task.  An eclectic group of people including ourselves and Ada offered our services and were given a name, time to meet, and directions to a local inn for the deep of pocket.  Madam Tealouse or Tealeaf or...  anyways something like that.

We were left waiting for what seemed like hours at the Saddle Gap Inn, but took the opportunity to get acquainted.  Two monastery folk who were absolutely antithetical to each other. The calm and confident Ekdos and some drunkard, devil half-breed named Creed. |creedSketch| A local, upright |rolandUptight| sword named Roland. And, a foreigner with the vaguest of titles for a name… “He who dreams.”  We have never seen someone like the Foreigner or the half-breed before.  We’ve read stories about the foreigner’s ancestry. Humaphants? Elemans?  The devil… We are uncertain of.  Both of them will prove to be interesting specimens to study, alive and dead.

A half-height woman finally graced us with her presence and we were given details on what we were to do and what we would be paid upon completion.  Find her kid, Finkas, who didn’t show up in Wolf Point as expected six months ago.  He took a bunch of people with too much time and money on their hands to find some lost city of gold.  It is doubtful our expedition will produce anything more than scattered bones.  Let us hope the bones will not be ours.  We won’t complain about the extra coin on the other side, though

Later, we found out the hard way that an anonymous somebody hired an anonymous somebody to hire some more, thuggish anonymous sombodies to give anyone looking for the Teahouse kid a roughing up.  The second anonymous somebody, we discovered, is a local fixer named Rook.  She didn’t really hire the best anonymous somebodies money could buy and that cost some people their lives tonight.  A limited show of force was enough for Rook to spill the beans about the first anonymous somebody on the other side of the mountain wanting to disrupt any attempt to recover the half-height kid.

Tomorrow, just after sunrise, we leave this useless town.  Tomorrow, we get even further away from our pursuers.  Tomorrow...
